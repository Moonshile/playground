### Response Type
Question 3

### Analysis Of the Student Answer
The student's answer, "Imagine a white beautiful school covered by heavy snow, which looks like a fairy tale world," is a strong hook sentence. It uses the DESCRIPTION strategy by painting a vivid picture for the reader and inviting them to imagine a magical scene. There is a minor grammar improvement possible: "a white beautiful school" would sound more natural as "a beautiful white school." Otherwise, the sentence is creative and effective.
